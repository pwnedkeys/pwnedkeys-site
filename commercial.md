If you are interested in using the pwnedkeys.com dataset in your product,
and want to be sure of on-going support and maintenance, the best way to do
that is by purchasing a support contract.  This gives you:

* E-mail based technical support for the API and associated services;

* Access to the [offline filtering](filter.html) dataset, which is
   particularly useful for high-volume querying applications;

* Higher rate limits when querying the [pwnedkeys.com API](api/index.html);

* The warm, fuzzy feeling that you are ensuring the continued expansion of
   the pwnedkeys.com database, as your support allows us to spend more time
   identifying and collecting compromised keys.

If you would like to discuss pricing for commercial support, please [contact us](mailto:sales@pwnedkeys.com).

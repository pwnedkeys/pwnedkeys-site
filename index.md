Want to know if a private key is in the wild?  This site is for you.  We
collect private keys, and provide signatures made by those keys, so you can
prevent their use.

To see whether a key is in our database, [look it up](search.html).

If you have a compromised key, please [submit
it](submit.html).

If you have questions or comments, feel free to check out [the FAQ](faq.html)
or [contact us](mailto:contact@pwnedkeys.com).

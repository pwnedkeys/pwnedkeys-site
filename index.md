Private keys are supposed to be, well... *private*.  If a key is out there
"in the wild", anyone could have it.  Anyone could be using it to
compromise your security.

Want to know if a private key is in the wild?  This site is for you.  We
collect private keys, and provide you with proof they're compromised, so
you can know when a key is untrustworthy.

To see whether a key is in our database, [look it up](search.html).

If you have a compromised key, please [submit
it](submit.html).

If you have questions or comments, feel free to check out [the FAQ](faq.html)
or [contact us](mailto:contact@pwnedkeys.com).
